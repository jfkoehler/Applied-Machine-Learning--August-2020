    "\n",
    "[Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/) allows users to browse and rent thousands of designer quality clothes so their users can always be wearing stylish apparel without breaking the bank. With thousands of options to choose, all with varying sizes and styles, the shopping experience could quickly become overwhelming without some degree of personalization. From a business perspective, revenue can be increased by presenting users with the right offer, the right product, at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "What features of a recommender system make it effective for both the business (increase revenue) and the user experience (personalize information space)? In addition to collaborative filtering approaches, how can other techniques (content based, rule based, or hybrid) be used to augment the recommendation engine? How should these methods be measured within the context of the business objectives of Rent the Runway?\n",
